## Development

This app was developed to learn how to implement features that use a device's native features, such as camera and location, and to store data within the device's memory.

### Using camera

This app uses the `image_picker` package in order to have access to the device's camera and library.

### Device's location

By using the `location` package and the `Google Maps Platform`, this app displays the user's current location, also allowing the user to select a location on a map.

    <img src="readme_assets/select_on_map.gif" height=300 alt="Image 2"  style="height:350">
</div>

### Storing data

This app saves the locations in the device's memory.
