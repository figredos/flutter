## WHAT IS FLUTTER

Flutter is an UI Framework, meaning flutter is a collection of code packages and utility functions for writing cross platform app code. With flutter the developer is able to have a single codebase, and yet generate apps for a variety of platforms, such as Android, IOS, Windows, macOS, linux and web.

Flutter combines the UI Framework with a collection of tools (CLI and software) that helps with developing, testing and building cross-platform apps. The single codebase does not run on all platforms natively, instead, with the help of the tools, flutter translates it into machine code for each platform.

The main objective of flutter is allowing devs to build multi-platform apps based on one single codebase and programming language.

## FLUTTER USES DART

FLUTTER IS NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, it's a framework for building user interfaces with DART. Dart is the programming language responsible for the functioning of flutter. It is developed by google, and although it can have other usages outside of flutter, the latter accounts for it's main usage.

## ONE CODEBASE MULTIPLE PLATFORMS

Although flutter can be built for many platforms, and written on all platforms, you can only test and run most of these apps on their respective platforms. For instance, IOS and macOS apps can only be tested and run on macOS machines, the same goes for windows and linux. Android and web apps on the other hand, can be built on all operating systems.
