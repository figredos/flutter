## Development

### Handling user input

To add a new meal, this app uses the *Form Widget*. This widget offers versatility and makes it easier to validate and modify the user's input.

### Backend and handling errors

This app is a simple introduction to using a third-party service to store data generated in the app, in this case the chosen backend is *Firebase*. To properly use any type of backend, it's important to handle cases where something goes wrong. This is done by using circular progress indicators, showing error messages and so on.
